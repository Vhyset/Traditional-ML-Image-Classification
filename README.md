# Traditional-ML-Image-Classification
Image Classification using traditional ML methods

## By: Alex B Tucker
--------------------

This project takes a labelled dataset of playing card images from multiple decks, and attempts to classify them based on value only - The suit is ignored.

The dataset was found on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/cards-image-datasetclassification

Download the dataset from Kaggle before running the script.

Only traditional machine learning methods are used. The validation accuracy is around 80 percent.

In another repository on my profile, you may find this dataset addressed using a neural network.
